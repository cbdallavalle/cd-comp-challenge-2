# cd-comp-challenge-2

The goal of this project was to recreate the provided image in a webpage, using HTML and CSS. I was allowed to choose my own topic, colors, images and font to fit my own design preferences. I am an avid pokemon lover, so I chose to recreate this challenge by replacing each profile with a pokemon card! I decided to give the cards a fixed width and height so they stay consistent when the webpage changes. I put a display of flex on the container that holds the cards, so that when the webpage is condensed, the cards that would be cut off by the window, instead drop down to create a new row. On mobile, only one card is shown in each row, creating a total of 8 rows. I also removed the text navigation options in favor for the logos because the text was quite small and distracted from the layout.
